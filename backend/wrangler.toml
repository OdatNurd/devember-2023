# For CF Images setup, set up an account and make a note of your account hash,
# which is readily visible in the images dashboard. Then, set up a page rewrite
# rule to get at the images for the assigned domain more directly:
#
#  1. Log into the CF dash and navigate to the website you want to serve from
#  2. Select Rules > Transform Rules and pick Create Rule; give it a name
#  3. Choose 'Custom Expression', click the Edit Expression Link
#     - Expression: (http.request.uri.path matches "^/images/.*$")
#  4. Choose 'Then > Rewrite To > Dynamic' and edit the expression
#     - concat( "/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/Dx4jrYPNAcY0IcNpYD9HJA", substring(http.request.uri.path, 7) )
#
# In #4, the dx4jr bit is your account hash; that is available in CF Images
#
# Images are now available under:
#   https://luddatumbazo.odatnurd.net/images/<IMAGEID>/<VARIANT-NAME>
#   https://luddatumbazo.odatnurd.net/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/Dx4jrYPNAcY0IcNpYD9HJA/<IMAGEID>/<VARIANT-NAME>
#   https://imagedelivery.net/Dx4jrYPNAcY0IcNpYD9HJA/<IMAGEID>/<VARIANT-NAME>
#
# The first two of these are gated behind any IAM, but the third ia always
# public unless the image is not public (in which case the request will require
# a key).
